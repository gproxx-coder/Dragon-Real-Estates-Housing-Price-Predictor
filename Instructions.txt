*Project Name: Housing Price Detector for Dragon Real Estates Company.


*Dataset Used: Boston Housing Data from UCI ML Repository. 


*Dataset link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/


*Objective of Project:
    -There is a company named Dragon Real Estates Pvt. Ltd.

    -We have to make such a Machine Learning model for them so that they can
    predict house price and achieve their goals easily.
    
    -User will insert 13 Features one by one.
    
    -Our Machine Learning Model will predict Price (Label) based on the Features.


*Instruction of usage:
    1. Open predictor.py file
    2. Run the code.
    3. Insert 13 features one by one.
    4. It will predict MEDV i.e. Price of house in $1000's
    
**Note: More information about dataset is given in housing.names file.
